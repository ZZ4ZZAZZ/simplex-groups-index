# Index Guidelines

## For Nomenclature, Style (Markdown), Naming, Description & text, Link and Order

1. **Invite links can be from anyone** (keep in mind that greater connection uptime of the invite link (respectively its host) makes users connect faster).

2. **Invite links are named after the group's name on SimpleX, and preceeded by the symbols
   `#` (private group chat) or `@` (user chat/bot)** (which are used by CLI). Example: [#Example_Group-1](https://simplex.chat/)

3. **Titles on this index must reflect topic**, otherwise it defaults to the actual group's name by me.

4. Entry Syling (Markdown):

- Private Group:

```markdown
- **Name** (Summary): [#Group Name on SimpleX](URL)
  - Additional Description or miscellaneous.
```

- User/Bot:

```markdown
- **Name** (Summary): [@User Name on SimpleX](URL)
  - Additional Description or miscellaneous.
```

(Both brief summary and additional description can bs omitted)

- Example private group in Markdown (doesn't exist):

```markdown
- **Example.com** (Example.com unofficial group): [#Example.com](https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=1-1&smp=smp%2%4%7%6Nai8JANA8nnJIjnaua82nNJHana8naniajma%3D%40smp0.simplex.im%2FT4aN-mK2Y_i98yxrEjsTtJZ-zdZnPlXu%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%JA7W82Jjw78JSIS8wmwR1Q44WKwY8VScrwJshayamJSJAJAAHH8naua7NUa8ajI8baua7HN%BHHajajxid.onion)
  - Discussion about anything on Example.com & related. No moderation.
```

5. Ordering: Headings, order and sections are open to improvement.

6. ???

7. Content restrictions: None, besides grave inappropriate topics (my own rules)

8. Contributing: _TODO_
